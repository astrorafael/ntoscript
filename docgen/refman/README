This is the document generation directory.
To generate documentation:
1) Edit RootDir in filelist.fs
2) Run docgen.sh shell script

ORGANIZATION
============

As suggested by the VFX user's manual, the doc generation is organized 
around these files:

- docgen.sh:   The main script dirver
- filelist.fs:  List of files for DocGen to generate .tex or .html
- titlepg.man: TexInfo title page (not needed in html generation)
